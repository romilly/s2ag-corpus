This is experimental code to explore importing the Semantic Scholar Academic
Graph Corpus into a PostgreSQL database.

The database will be running on a Raspberry Pi. Since the data contains close to a terabyte of data,
this is quite a challenge.

If all goes well it will be used to kickstart an open source project that will allow users to
create and update a local copy of the Semantic Scholar Corpus and to use the Semantic Scholar Web interface to identify
and explore papers of topical interest.

Thanks to the Allen Institute for AI for making the Semantic Scholar data freely available.
