This is experimental code to explore importing the Semantic Scholar Academic
Graph Corpus into a PostgreSQL database.

If all goes well it will be used to kickstart an open source project that will allow users to
create and update a local copy of the Semantic Scholar Corpus and to use the Semantic Scholar Web interface to identify
and explore papers of topical interest.
