## The hardware I use

Much of the development is done on my Linux workstation, but the production system
runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a Pimoroni NVME hat and a 4 TB NVME SSD.

Loading the database takes over a day, but than only needs to be done once.

Once loaded, it typically takes under an hour to apply a set of weekly diffs.
